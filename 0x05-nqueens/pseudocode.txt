N queens problem
Problem:
- The need to print out the coordinates ofN queens where they can be placed on the 
  chess board N that they can't attack each other

Pseudocode:
- generate the chess board N intializing all points with "empty"
- create recursive function "solveQueens" where the solutions will be gotten from
- pass in the initialized board, N and initial row to the function
	- check if the row equals N
		- create function "printQueen" to print solution for the line
		- return if so
	- loop through the columns in range of N
		- create a function "checkSafe" to check if it is safe to place a queen
		- pass in the board, N, row, column to the function "checkSafe"
			- check through horizontally upwards provided row and col
    	  		  are greater than 0
				- if row and col on board is "Queen" return false 
			- check left upper diagional if a queen is present and return false
			- check right upper diagonal if a queen is present and return false
			- return true if still in the function, it shows that row, col is free
		- check if "checkSafe" is true
			- set row and col on board to "Queen"
			- because i've seen a safe spot i call the function "SolveQueens" incrementing the row
			- set rown and col on board to default "Empty"
