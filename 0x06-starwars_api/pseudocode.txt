- check for correct arguments (we want to be to get 1 arg from terminal)

	- resolve body.characters
- create and store a function that takes in a url from characters array and resolves the name gotten from the url
- create async function
- create a new Array
- await the resolved promise to get array of characters
- loop through the array of characters and push the resolved val of each character to new Array
